# MATLAB Simulink Projects

This repository contains a collection of **MATLAB Simulink models** developed for educational and reference purposes. The models are implemented using **MATLAB R2024a** and are free to download, study, and modify.

## Description

These models aim to demonstrate common control logic patterns, simulation techniques, and system behaviors using Simulink and standard libraries. Each model is self-contained and includes documentation either within the file or in a folder-specific `README.md`.

## Compatibility

- MATLAB Version: **R2024a**
- Simulink Toolbox: Standard (others may be used where needed)

## License and Usage

All models in this repository are open for personal, academic, or professional use. Attribution is appreciated but not required.

## Contributions

- Contributions to improve or expand the documentation are welcome.
- If you have **legacy versions** of MATLAB and need compatible copies of the models, feel free to request them.
- Community contributions of legacy-compatible models are encouraged and appreciated.
